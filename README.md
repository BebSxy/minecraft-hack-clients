### News
I'm open to adding clients from discord servers (even if its paid). Make a new issue or pull request following the Template.

## Some Info
* If you have a suggestion make an issue or pull request following the template.
* **DISCLAIMER:** I'm not responsible if these are ratted or have a virus. Download these at your own risk.
* If you spot something wrong make an issue.
* I'll try have the popular clients on top. Since most of them are bad. (I plan on making these alphabetical)
