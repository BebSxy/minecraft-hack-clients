# Minecraft Hack Clients
A collection of Minecraft Hack Clients. Some open source some not.

## Some Info
* If you have a suggestion make an issue and tell me the **Name, Github/Website Link, Version, Description, Download Link/Compile Yourself, and if its Ratted**.
* **Note:** I'm not responsible if these are ratted. I usually check the issues to see if someone spotted a token grabber or something.
* If you spot something wrong make an issue.
* When I have more hack clients in the list, I'll have the popular clients on top. Since most of them are shit clients.

Template: `* [Name](Github/Website Link) (Version) - Description. [Download/Compile Yourself](Link) (RAT or NOT)`
