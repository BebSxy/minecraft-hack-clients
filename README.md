# Minecraft Hack Clients
A collection of Minecraft Hack Clients. Some open source some not. Some good but mostly bad.

### News
I added a license you should be able to contribute.

## Some Info
* If you have a suggestion make an issue and tell me the **Name, Github/Website/Discord Link, Version, Description, Download Link/Compile Yourself/Pay, and if its Ratted**.
* **Note:** I'm not responsible if these are ratted. I usually check the issues to see if someone spotted a token grabber or something.
* If you spot something wrong make an issue.
* I'll try have the popular clients on top. Since most of them are bad.
